## [5.1.3] - 2023-02-25

### Fixed

- Image has already been loaded (https://github.com/rpearce/react-medium-image-zoom/pull/389)

## [5.1.2] - 2022-10-25

### Fixed

- Image is hidden when pressing escape during hiding animation (issue #378)

## [5.1.1] - 2022-10-14

### Fixed

- `zoomMargin` portion of "Neither zoomMargin nor scrollableEl seem to be working
  correctly" (issue #350)
- Clicking on zoomed SVGs doesn't unzoom (issue #369)

## [5.1.0] - 2022-10-11

### Added

- Ability to customize the zoom modal content via `<ZoomContent>` (issue #332)
- Re-added `wrapElement` prop to API; only supports `'div' | 'span'` (issue #356)
- Added a11y support for `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` (issue #359)
- Added `classDialog` string prop to account for the loss of granular styling
  control over different modals resulting from moving the `<dialog>` rendering
  to a portal

### Changed

- Now rendering `<dialog>` in a portal because of #356
  - For the folx using `.my-class [data-rmiz-modal] {}` to change the `<dialog>`
    styles, please use the `classDialog` prop to pass `my-class` to the
    `<dialog>`. I wish I didn't have to do this, but this is something that
    needs fixing, and I can't justify a new major version just because of this
    new style requirement. The `classDialog` addition (mentioned above) should
    solve this nicely.

### Fixed

- Now using the `wheel` event instead of `scroll` to detect trying to leave the
  modal (issue #350)
- Fixed mobile scrolling experience (related to issue #350)

### Removed

- Removed the broken `scrollableEl` that has arguably not ever worked (issue #350)

## [5.0.3] - 2022-09-19

  older than LTS)

## [5.0.1] - 2022-08-04

### Fixed

## [5.0.0] - 2022-08-03

## [2.0.5] - 2017-11-01

### Fixed

- Fixed issue where updating other image attributes after mounting was not respected; the image was cached in `this.state` when only the `src` should have been.
